title: Expo CLI
---

Expo CLI is a command line app that is the main interface between a developer and Expo tools. You'll use it for a variety of tasks, such as:

- Creating new projects
- Developing your app: running the project server, viewing logs, opening your app in a simulator 
- [Publishing](../publishing/) your app JavaScript and other assets and managing releasing them over the air
- [Building binaries](../../distribution/building-standalone-apps/) (`apk` and `ipa` files) to be [uploaded to the App Store and Play Store](../../distribution/uploading-apps/)
- Managing Apple Credentials and Google Keystores

You may use the CLI in your terminal or use the web based interface (it opens automatically by default, or you can press d from the CLI to open it on demand). The web interface you to use some of the most often used features from a quick-to-use graphical interface. Weâ€™ve only scratched the surface of what expo-cli can do so far. Be sure to check out all the possible commands below!
